Pages, carefully selected and removed from the antique book have warm golden tone that gives them that special charm and makes perfect background for the illustrations digitally printed directly on the page. \r\n\r\nThe actual page you will receive won\u2019t be the exact one shown in the picture - the text will be different. Pages, often 150 years old, may have minor imperfections, such as spots, corner bends, uneven printing, etc. It adds to the charm! Each creation is unique, no two pages are alike, but If you order more than one, your prints will all be from the same book so you\u2019ll have a wonderful set that will look great on your wall.\r\n\r\nART PRINT SIZE\r\nPage size is approximately 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; (inches) with very slight variation.\r\nPerfect for a standard 8&quot; x 10&quot; or 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; frame or 10&quot; x 13&quot; or 11&quot; x 14&quot; frame with 8&quot; x 10&quot; mat opening. \r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION - ORIGINAL ARTWORK!\r\nOriginal concept and design based on the images from past centuries. \r\n\r\nHIGH QUALITY PRINT\r\nProfessional print process: deep shiny black, vivid colors and sharpess that can&#39;t be achieved with a home inkjet printer.\r\n\r\nPACKAGING\r\nAll prints will be packaged in an acid-free, protective sleeve in a large stay flat cartboard envelope.","creation_tsz":1422031250,"ending_tsz":1432395650,"original_creation_tsz":1353538283,"last_modified_tsz":1422031250,"price":"12.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":8,"tags":["Art Print","Collage","Book Art","Print","Dictionary Art Print","Vintage Art Print","Antique Book Print","Dictionary Print","Wall Art","Upcycled","Geekery","Kitsch","Monkeys and Apes"],"category_path":["Geekery","Kitsch","Art"],"category_path_ids":[69150359,68888560,68929490],"materials":[],"shop_section_id":12062177,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1422022828,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/115785667\/gorilla-cyclist-original-artwork?utm_source=explorer&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":142,"num_favorers":10,"shipping_template_id":8953949793,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":3,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":"graduation","style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":398269864,"hex_code":"BDA66C","red":189,"green":166,"blue":108,"hue":43,"saturation":42,"brightness":74,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1353538284,"listing_id":115785667,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/003\/0\/7162119\/il_75x75.398269864_fy1w.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/003\/0\/7162119\/il_170x135.398269864_fy1w.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/003\/0\/7162119\/il_570xN.398269864_fy1w.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/003\/0\/7162119\/il_fullxfull.398269864_fy1w.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":860},{"listing_image_id":398269874,"hex_code":"747066","red":116,"green":112,"blue":102,"hue":43,"saturation":12,"brightness":45,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1353538284,"listing_id":115785667,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/002\/0\/7162119\/il_75x75.398269874_bfoy.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/002\/0\/7162119\/il_170x135.398269874_bfoy.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/002\/0\/7162119\/il_570xN.398269874_bfoy.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/002\/0\/7162119\/il_fullxfull.398269874_bfoy.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":860},{"listing_image_id":398269866,"hex_code":"C7BEA5","red":199,"green":190,"blue":165,"hue":44,"saturation":17,"brightness":78,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1353538284,"listing_id":115785667,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/005\/0\/7162119\/il_75x75.398269866_j3ja.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/005\/0\/7162119\/il_170x135.398269866_j3ja.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/005\/0\/7162119\/il_570xN.398269866_j3ja.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/005\/0\/7162119\/il_fullxfull.398269866_j3ja.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":860},{"listing_image_id":398263711,"hex_code":"7A786B","red":122,"green":120,"blue":107,"hue":52,"saturation":12,"brightness":47,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1353538284,"listing_id":115785667,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/005\/0\/7162119\/il_75x75.398263711_5zg9.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/005\/0\/7162119\/il_170x135.398263711_5zg9.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/005\/0\/7162119\/il_570xN.398263711_5zg9.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/005\/0\/7162119\/il_fullxfull.398263711_5zg9.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":860},{"listing_image_id":368317594,"hex_code":"DDDBDA","red":221,"green":219,"blue":218,"hue":20,"saturation":1,"brightness":86,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1353538284,"listing_id":115785667,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/7162119\/il_75x75.368317594_kw5e.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/7162119\/il_170x135.368317594_kw5e.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/7162119\/il_570xN.368317594_kw5e.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/006\/0\/7162119\/il_fullxfull.368317594_kw5e.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":860}],"Shop":{"shop_id":7162119,"shop_name":"MadameBricolagePrint","user_id":23761631,"creation_tsz":1345756652,"title":"High Quality Art Prints on Antique Dictionary Paper","announcement":"Buy 3 Prints get 1 FREE! \r\nBuy 6 Prints get 2 FREE!\r\nBuy 9 Prints get 3 FREE! etc.\r\n\r\nPlease DO NOT purchase the items you want for free.
